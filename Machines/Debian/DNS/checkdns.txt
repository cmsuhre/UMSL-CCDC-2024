1. check internet connection
ping 8.8.8.8
If destination is unreachable check if your gateway 10.0.2.2 is reachable. And fix the problem.

if connection is fine you would see something like :

PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=46 time=4.13 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=46 time=4.13 ms


2. Check if host/dig send packets properly:
sudo tcpdump -n -i en0  host 8.8.8.8   



3. At the same time from another console in the same machine
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
You will get response similar to:

tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on eth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 65535 bytes
13:34:00.980550 IP 10.0.2.15.56570 > 8.8.8.8.53: 47059+ A? google.com. (27)
13:34:05.980541 IP 10.0.2.15.56570 > 8.8.8.8.53: 47059+ A? google.com. (27)
This means that the request had pass to the external network but did not come back...
